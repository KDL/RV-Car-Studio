	Click on "create\spline\linestrip".  
	Then go to the view "right" (one of the side views)

	Then click on the little 'X' in the center of the view and move up. 
	Now u have to create a line of multiple points.
	(I recommend not using more than 15 points on the top line, it will help cut down on the amount of polies).
